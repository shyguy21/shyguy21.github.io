            I had a problem where i wanted some padding in between pictures but I also wanted a border on the pictures, and the padding would expand the border and it looked ugly. So i tried to search up what I could do but I didnt find anything. Then I tries using Margin auto, which then worked as it moved the photo where I wanted it to go and the border was still in the photo.
            Another problem i had was figuring out how to space out my links for the other pages. I searched it up online and it told me to put a lot of these(& nbsp)in between and it will space them out. For the planning I just started to look at different review websites on the web and I took some inspiration from that. For the layout i used the grid layout which Mr. Drenth used.
            I think my website is good because of the pictures that i have added. I also think people would enjoy the background picture on the header because it shows how Apple and andriod do get long sometimes. I think that people would want to visit my website because its interesting and the content is factual and inriching.
            I would give it a level 4- because of how the colour scheme works well with everything and how the header has a lot of detail with the links and how if you hover over one it shows a brighter colour to see better. Also every page links to every page and it has a lot of detail. The information is valid and the overall best choice is well supported by the evidence.
            It is kind of spaced out a little and there is empty spaces here and there. Some pictures didn't align well but its okay. Thats why I think i deserve a 4-.
